## 📝 Description
> Create an AI that (tries) to chat like you.

pistoBot is my free-time project developed during the italian COVID-19 quarantine.<br> And a very good opportunity to learn.

----

## 🔫 In a shot
➡ Get your WhatsApp and telegram chats.<br>
➡ Parse them to get a machine-learning ready dataset.<br>
➡ Train one of the machine learning models with it.

## ✋ I want one
Use this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T4-Gk-mlAWJkX9RuRd3_EiS5JBP5UvyV?usp=sharing) and just follow the instructions.

**❗ Attention**<br>
<small>
    It's always better not to run random scripts on personal information (like personal chat messages).<br>
    I guarantee there is no double end, but you can always check (and use) the native code:
    [messaging-chat-parser](https://github.com/pistocop/messaging-chat-parser) and
    [pistobot](https://github.com/pistocop/pistoBot)
